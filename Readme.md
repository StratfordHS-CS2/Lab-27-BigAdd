# Lab 27 - Big Add

## Lab Goal
You will write a program that can add very large integers.  The numbers will be too large to have java add them in the usual way.

## Instructions
* Complete the method `doAdd` that accepts two large numbers as Strings and returns a String containing the sum of the two numbers.
* You can assume the two numbers are the same number of digits, but your program should work with any length of number.
* I suggest testing with smaller numbers that you can add manually.
* One approach is to convert the number from a string to an array or arraylist, then add the numbers digit by digit.
* Complete all javadoc comments with the proper tags.

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 45 - Answer has the correct number of digits
* 45 - Answer is correct
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
